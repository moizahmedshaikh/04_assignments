# Write a program to print terms in the Fibonacci sequence up to a maximum value.

# In the 13th century, the Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, as a way to explain the geometric growth of a population of rabbits, devised a mathematical sequence that now bears his name. The first two terms in this sequence, Fib(0) and Fib(1), are 0 and 1, and every subsequent term is the sum of the preceding two. Thus, the first several terms in the Fibonacci sequence look like this:

# Fib(0) = 0 Fib(1) = 1 Fib(2) = 1 = 0 + 1 Fib(3) = 2 = 1 + 1 Fib(4) = 3 = 1 + 2 Fib(5) = 5 = 2 + 3

# Write a program that displays the terms in the Fibonacci sequence, starting with Fib(0) and continuing as long as the terms are less than 10,000 (you should store this value as a constant!). Thus, your program should produce the following sample run:



MAX_VALUE = 10000

def main():
    curr_term = 0
    next_term = 1

    while curr_term < MAX_VALUE:
        print(curr_term)
        curr_term,next_term = next_term, curr_term + next_term

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
